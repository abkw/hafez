
# Hafez

## Overview

**Hafez** is a Python-based project designed to streamline data collection, preprocessing, and training pipelines. It provides a modular structure for building scalable machine learning workflows, supporting various components such as data collection, preprocessing, and model training.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Efficient tools for fetching and managing datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Built-in utilities for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for training.
- **Model Training**: Customizable scripts for training machine learning models.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design to easily add or modify components.
